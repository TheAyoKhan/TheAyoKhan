# Hi! I'm Ayaan Khan
I'm not very good at coding, but here you are, at my own Githug Profile. Here you can see about me and check my not so good Github Stats (courtesy of [https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats](anuraghazra "github-readme-stats"))

# Who am I?
I'm a kid from Ontario aspring to be a web developer. Of course, I've already learned HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Relating to Javascript, I've also learned React, Typescript, and React + Typescript. However, I've learned some languages somewhat unrelated to web dev, such as Python, very small amounts of C#, among others.
